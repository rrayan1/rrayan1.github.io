description: >-
  Iâ€™m a recent graduate from the American University of Beirut (AUB) with a strong focus on robotics, control systems, and application development.
  My passion lies in building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between hardware and software. I specialize in designing and implementing real-time control algorithms, modeling dynamic systems, 
  and developing cross-platform applications using Flutter, integrated with ROS, Node.js, and custom backends.
  Whether it's stabilizing nonlinear systems or creating user interfaces to interact with them, I enjoy delivering full-stack solutions that are both robust and user-centric.
