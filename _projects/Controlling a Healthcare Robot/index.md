title: Controlling a Healthcare Robot using a Mobile Application
description: >-  
  An autonomous mobile robot controlled via a Flutter-based mobile application, supported by a Node.js backend.  
  The system allows nurses to send real-time delivery requests, monitor robot status, and view its live location.  
  The robot communicates with the backend through Wi-Fi, while ROS handles low-level control, including motion planning and feedback-based navigation.  
  A differential-drive model is used, with controllers like PID and LQR implemented for stability and trajectory tracking.
skills:
  - ROS
  - Flutter
  - Node.js
  - PID & LQR Control
  - Arduino

## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}
