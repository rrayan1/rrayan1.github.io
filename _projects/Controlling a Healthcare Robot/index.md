title: Controlling a Healthcare Robot using a Mobile Application
description: >-  
  An autonomous mobile robot controlled via a Flutter-based mobile application, supported by a Node.js backend.  
  The system allows nurses to send real-time delivery requests, monitor robot status, and view its live location.  
  The robot communicates with the backend through Wi-Fi, while ROS handles low-level control, including motion planning and feedback-based navigation.  
  A differential-drive model is used, with controllers like PID and LQR implemented for stability and trajectory tracking.
skills:
  - ROS
  - Flutter
  - Node.js
  - PID & LQR Control
  - Arduino
